## Introduction-to-Optimization
This code is part of the introduction to optimization optimization course EE2102505 in department of electrical engineering at Chulalongkorn university.

## Contour_definite_matrix
This python notebook shows how the contour shape changes when the characteristic(pdf, psdf, indefinite matrix) of the matrix $P$ in $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TPx$ changes.
## NumericalExample
This file shows numerical problems of unconstrained optimization, linear program(LP), quadratic program(QP) and how to formulate the problem and solve it by using libraries in Python such as scipy and cvxopt or in MATLAB using optimization toolbox.
